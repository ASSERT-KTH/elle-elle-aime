# The enumerate function should be helpful for you here.
# It takes in a sequence (either a list or a tuple)
# and returns an iteration of pairs each of which
# contains the index of the element and the element itself.
# Here's how to use it.

# for i, elem in enumerate((4, 10, 1, 3)):
#     print("I am in the", i ,"position and I am", elem)
# 
# I am in the 0 position and I am 4
# I am in the 1 position and I am 10
# I am in the 2 position and I am 1
# I am in the 3 position and I am 3
